Use vector_field_2d to plot a vector field in the plane.
Modify V1 and V2 to be the components of your vector field.
Choose domain by choosing x_min, x_max, y_min, y_max.

Use vector_field_3d to plot a vector field in space.
Modify V1, V2, and V3 to be the components of your vector field.
Choose domain by choosing x_min, x_max, y_min, y_max, z_min, z_max.

DO NOT! modify the functions in the directory:
