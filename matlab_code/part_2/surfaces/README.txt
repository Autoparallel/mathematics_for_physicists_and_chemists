explicit_surface.m plots a surface defined by the graph of a function
f. Use the variables x, y to modify this function.

implicit_surface.m plots the level surfaces for a given scalar field
f. In particular, it plots the set of points (x,y,z) such that
    f(x,y,z) = constant.
To use: Select a constant value and define your f. Adjust the window
for the plot as needed by setting
x_min, x_max, ... etc.
